# Facial-Emotion-Detection

## How to run this project

## Aim of the project
Given an image you need to predict if the person in the image is happy or not.

## Code Design:
Step 1: Used **Open Face** library for Feature extraction from the input images 
Open face is an open source toolkit used to convert image data into a csv file format (dataset) .More details can be found at following links:  (https://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/) , (https://github.com/Prodesire/face-mask)

Step 2: Developed a **Genetic Algorithm** (Local Search Algorithm) for Feature Selection: write details of each function.Show how by using different operators and adjusting the parameters of the search algorithm, brings about a  difference in the Space and Time of the search process, and also the Quality of the search solution

Step 3: Used **KNN** algorithm for training and solving classification problem
