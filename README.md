# Facial-Emotion-Detection

## How to run this project


## aim of the project

Feature subset selection for different emotions: 
➢ Find out Which subset of features will best identify happy faces? 
Which subset of features will best identify angry faces?... 
➢ Each group choose and work on one Local search algorithm (GA, PSO, any variants) and one specific  emotion. {Anger, Surprise, Fear, Contempt, Sadness, Happiness, Disgust} 
➢ Show how by using different operators and adjusting the parameters of the search algorithm, brings about a  difference in the Space and Time of the search process, and also the Quality of the search solution. ➢ Train and validate the model using CK+ dataset. 
➢ Take masked and unmasked photos of your team and share the annotated image files of different emotions in a shared folder. 
➢ Test the model with the images of your team members and classmates.  

## Code Design:
Step 1: Used **Open Face** library for Feature creation 
Open face is an open source toolkit used to convert image data into a csv file format dataset .More details can be found on following links.

Step 2: Developed a **Genetic Algorithm** for Feature Selection: write details of each function

Step 3: Used **KNN** for solving classification problem
